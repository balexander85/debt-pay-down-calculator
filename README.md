# debt-pay-down-calculator
I found this nifty debt pay down calculator on bankrate.com
but to use it you have to manually go through all these steps
to generate a debt pay down plan. I wanted to be able to setup
my loans and credit cards with balances and info saved and then
run a script to generate a plan. Then I could make tweaks to my
details and generate a new plan. Based on outcomes of my tweaks
I could then take action on the plan that has the best outcome.
